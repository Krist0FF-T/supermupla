# SuperMuPla ([Magyar](https://github.com/Krist0FF-T/supermupla/blob/main/README-HU.md))
SuperMuPla is:
- really early in development... you couldn't even call it a game
- going to be (hopefully) a simple 2D platformer game written, configurable, and extensible in Python (custom enemies, blocks and levels).
- a cleaner rewrite of [SuperMuki](https://github.com/Krist0FF-T/supermuki), which I wrote in February 2022
- inspired by
    - [SuperTux](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux), Super Mario Bros, and some other 2D platformers starting with "Super"
    - Fireboy & Watergirl (Local Co-Op)

# Fun facts

Name origin:
- it was generated by a script I wrote that generates new words based on what characters follow each other in the input words, which were "super", "platformer" and "multiplayer"
- i gave it meaning afterwards
- super: because many 2d platformers start with "super"
- mu: **mu**lti- (-player)
- pla: -**pla**yer or **pla**tformer
